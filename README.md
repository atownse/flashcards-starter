## Project Overview
We were tasked with adding code to a semi completed application. We were to build class files and test them to make sure they were running correctly and were operable. The final goal was to make these files work together so that through the console, a user could run and play the game and see how well they are doing as well as whether they answer certain questions correctly or not.

## Goals
My goal was to learn how to write tests and practice testing these files as well as learn how to effectively use beforeEach in the testing files.

## Technologies
The flashcards classes were built using Javascript.

## Challenges
Sad path testing: I believe I need to improve upon that and test for more fallibilities.
